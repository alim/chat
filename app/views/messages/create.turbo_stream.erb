<%#
  the turbo_stream.append method is being used to append the content of the
  @message object to the HTML element with the ID "messages"
  (see chat/app/views/rooms/show.html.erb). This involves adding the content
  of a newly created message to an existing list of messages on the page
  without needing a full page reload.

  This template goes with the MessagesController#create action.
%>
<%= turbo_stream.append "messages", @message %>
